        <p>
        Thanks for checking out my portfolio! My name is Eduard, and I am an aspiring full-stack web/app developer. 
        Currently, I am a student at Northwestern University in a 6-month cohort program to earn a certificate in Full Stack Web Development. 
        With a deep background as a program manager, a soon-to-be US Navy veteran, and branding/marketing experience on top of web development, 
        I intend to use all skills together to help my future clients exceed their business goals.
